## Project Description

Sentiment analysis is a key natural language processing (NLP) task that involves classifying text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This project leverages BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, to improve sentiment classification accuracy. The implementation includes preprocessing text data, tokenization using BERT's tokenizer, fine-tuning the BERT model, and evaluating its performance.



##Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

Python 3.x

PyTorch for deep learning

Transformers library (Hugging Face) for BERT implementation

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib for visualization

Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

##Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
cd sentiment-analysis-bert

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure that PyTorch and the Transformers library are properly installed:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install transformers

##How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1 - Prepare the dataset:

Place your text dataset in the appropriate folder (e.g., data/).

Ensure it is in CSV format with columns like text and label.

2 - Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially:

jupyter notebook "Sentiment Analysis with BERT Neural Network and Python.ipynb"

3 - Model Training and Evaluation:

The notebook includes the steps for training the model, evaluating performance, and visualizing results.

Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

4 - Results:

The final outputs include accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrices.



##Dataset

The project assumes a text-based dataset with sentiment labels. If you don't have a dataset, you can use publicly available datasets like:

IMDb Reviews Dataset

SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)

##Results

The model outputs:

Accuracy and loss during training and validation phases

Confusion matrix for model evaluation

Text classification predictions

Sample Results:

Model Accuracy: 92%

Loss Curve: Visualized in the notebook.
